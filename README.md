# Arwium

Arwium - a neural-network-based RED autoconfigurator.

---

## About

Arwium was a project done as a part of the Advanced Networking course at Colorado State University, during the Fall of 2018. The primary use-case of Arwium is to automatically find the best parametric configuration for network gateways that use the Random Early Detection algorithm for congestion avoidance. Automatic configuration of RED parameters will help taking the burden off network administrators, who might otherwise have to configure it manually. Arwium uses reinforcement learning based on observed network behavior to find optimum RED parameters, for a given network state.

The full report can be found <a href = "https://github.com/vignesh-pagadala/arwium-red-autoconfigurator/blob/main/RED-Autoconfigurator-Paper-Final.pdf">here</a>.

Arwium finds best values for the following RED parameters:

1. p(a, b, c, ...): Random drop probability of a packet.
2. maxP: Maximum drop probability.
3. Qmax: Maximum queue length threshold.
4. Qmin: Minimum queue length threshold.
5. Weight associated with the queue (for calculating average queue length).

For calculating the queue length, we use Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), for reasons stated in report. Q-Reinforcement Learning is used for the training process. For simulating the network environment, we use a discreet-events simulation package by <a href="https://www.grotto-networking.com/DiscreteEventPython.html">Grotto Networking</a>.
